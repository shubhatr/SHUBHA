Problem Statement -Smart Waste Management System using IoT(garbage level detector to send data to the main server for garbage collection)
Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the amount of garbage in the dustbin. If the level of garbage is greater than the threshold value 
then the GPS co-ordinates of the dustbin is shared to main server through cloud.The GPS co-ordinates are used to automatically show the 
address of the of the dustbin on Google Maps.
